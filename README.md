ReMASTER
========

ReMASTER is an in-progress rewrite of the [MASTER](https://tgvaughan.github.io/MASTER) tree simulation package
for [BEAST 2](https://beast2.org).

It aims to address the following problems with MASTER:
1. Slow and memory-intensive tree simulation
2. Awkward coalescent simulation
3. Difficult to configure sampling in BD models
4. Inflexible design

ReMASTER is in development and is not yet ready for use.
